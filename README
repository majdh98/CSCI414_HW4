Included is fs_find.c which can be compiled using the Makefile. At the moment, 
fs_find.c can only print the content of the root directory and the 
content for file1 in p1.img. p1.img is a 30mb partition with only one file 
(file1) that contains 137 occurrences of the letter a. 

The files dinode.h, dir.h, fs.h, and *.img must be in the same directory as
fs_find.c. 

The hexdump of p1.img, dumpfs of p1.img, and p1.img can be found using the
