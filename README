Included is fs_find.c and fs_cat.c which can be compiled using the Makefile. At the moment, 
both programs can deal with directories and files with size less than 12 blocks (384kib).
We tested these programs on p1.img, p2.img, p3.img, and p4.img which can be found 
here: https://github.com/majdh98/CSCI414_HW4 along with their hexdump and dumpfs.


To run fs_find on p1.img, run the following on a terminal:
$ make
$ ./fs_find p1.img
To run fs_cat on p1.img,  run the following on a terminal:
$ make
$ ./fs_find p1.img <path>

REQUIREMENTS: The files dinode.h, dir.h, fs.h, and *.img must be in the same directory as
fs_find.c. 

WARNING: we are reading *.img using read(2). The entire content of the disk 
image is being copied to a heap buffer of the same size. When the disk is large,
the heap might not have enough space for the buffer. This behavior can be 
optimized by using combinations of lseek and read depending on the situation.
