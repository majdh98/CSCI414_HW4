Included is fs_find.c which can be compiled using the Makefile. At the moment, 
fs_find.c can only print the content of the root directory and the 
content for file1 in p1.img. p1.img is a 30mb partition with only one file 
(file1) that contains 137 occurrences of the letter a. It can also print the 
content of file1 (uncomment lines 124-131 to observe this behavior).

To run the program on p1.img, run the following on a terminal:
$ make
$ ./fs_find p1.img

REQUIREMENTS: The files dinode.h, dir.h, fs.h, and *.img must be in the same directory as
fs_find.c. 

WARNING: we are reading *.img using read(2). The entire content of the disk 
image is being copied to a heap buffer of the same size. When the disk is large,
the heap might not have enough space for the buffer. This behavior can be 
optimized by using combinations of lseek and read depending on the situation. 


The hexdump of p1.img, dumpfs of p1.img, and p1.img can be found using the
